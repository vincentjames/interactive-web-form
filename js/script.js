//Problem: User interaction doesn't provide desired results.
//Solution: Add interactivty so the user can manage daily tasks.

//Add a task
	//when the button is pressed
	//create a new list item with the text from #new-task:
		//input (chexkbox)
		//label
		//input (text)
		//button.edit
		//button.delete
		//each elements, needs to be modified and appended


//Edit a task 
	//when the edit button is pressed
	//if the class of the parent is .editMode
		//switch from .editMode
		//label text becomes the inputs value
	//else
		//switch to .editMode
		//input value becomes the labels text

	//Toggle .editMode on the parent


//Delete a task
	//when the delete button is pressed 
		//remove the parent list item from the ul


//Mark a task as complete
	//when the checkbox is checked
		//append the task list item to the #completed-tasks


//Mark a task as incomplete
	//when the checkbox is unchecked
		//append the task list item to the #incomplete-tasks
